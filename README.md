## 🚀 About Me:
    I'm Full Stack Web Developer
I'm originally a Biochemical Engineer with a specialization in Food Science. 
I've always been intrigued by IT and software development, thinking about it since 2016 up until 2023 when I finally decided to
join "Soy Henry" in their Full Stack boot camp. I've never felt more satisfied with my work since joining them. I'm fullstack but I have more of an affinity towards
front-end development. I'm currently working on a project with 5 others. Lets network and watch each other grow and flourish as developers! 
## 🧙‍♀️ Other  Common  Github  Profile  Sections:

- 🌱 I'm a student at Soy Henry ✍ 
- 😄 Pronouns: They/Them / all pronouns
- ⚡ Fun Fact: I love learning and constantly like to try and learn new things.
